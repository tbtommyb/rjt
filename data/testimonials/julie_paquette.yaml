text: I started training with Roland over 6 months ago. I was quite skeptical on having a personal trainer at first, I must say I have completly changed my mind on this! Roland pushes me in a way that I would never be able to do by myself. I have seen real changes on my body over the past few months, I am fitter and I genuinely feel healthier and happier with my body. Finally, Roland has managed to make going to the gym a happy time time in my week, it is no longer a constraint to work out! Thank you for everything!
