  "I started training with Roland in April 2016. I'm in my mid thirties and was far from the best shape of my life.", 
  "Since training with him I have seen significant and consistent improvements in my strength, fitness and physique. I haven't had a single session where I haven't felt like I've worked hard and achieved something. Not only does he keep me motivated and focused but he explains what we're doing and why, so it's easy to see the value in everything.",
  "Throughout the training I've also gained a far better understanding of my diet and how to adjust it to see the best results. On top of all this he's a really good guy. If you want a fun, professional and hard working PT, and real results, I can't recommend Roland enough."
