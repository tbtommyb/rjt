text: I started training with Roland at the end of April 2016. I'm in my mid thirties and quite frankly was far from being in the shape of my life. Since training with him I have seen significant and consistent improvements in my strength, fitness and physique. I haven't had a single session where I haven't felt like I've worked hard and achieved something. Not only does he keep me motivated and focused but he explains what you're doing and why you're doing it so it's easy to see the value in everything you do in his sessions. Throughout the training I've also gained a far better understanding of my diet and how to adjust it to see the best results. On top of all this he's a really good guy. If you want a fun, professional and hard working PT, and real results, I can't recommend Roland enough.
